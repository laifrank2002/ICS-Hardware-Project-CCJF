				<h1>Components</h1>
				
				<h2 id="motherboard">Motherboard<h2>
				<img src="Motherboard.jpg" alt="Image of a motherboard">
				<p>The motherboard is the internal component of a computer that carries the CPU, expansion slots, 
				power connectors, memory chips (RAM and ROM), other microchips needed to function. It is also known 
				as the mainboard, baseboard, logic board, system board, etc. </p>
				
				<h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2>
				<img src="CPU.jpg" alt="Image of a CPU">
				<p>CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is a small electronic component that is occasionally 
				called the brain of the PC. The CPU is responsible for two things. One of them is to carry out commands 
				to make the other hardware parts perform the action. The other responsibility is to process data. Although 
				the instructions the CPU performs are simple, they can execute millions and millions of instructions every 
				second.  The fact that the CPU can perform many tasks is what makes a PC powerful.</p>
				
				<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
				<img src="Ram.jpg" alt="Image of two RAM">
				<p>(Random Access Memory)
				RAM is a card connected to the motherboard which is used to temporarily store information. As soon as 
				computer is turned off, information not saved inside the hard drive won’t be able to be recalled. The CPU 
				uses RAM when it’s operating because it needs to store temporary data while is operating. If more of RAM is 
				present inside the CPU, the faster the computer is since more data can be stored temporarily.</p>
				
				<h2 id="power supply">Power Supply</h2>
				<img src="Powersupply.jpg" alt="Image of a power supply">
				<p>The power supply is required to transform the incoming AC power into 5V and 12V DC power the other 
				internal components of the PC. </p>
				
				<h2 id="sound card">Sound Card</h2>
				<img src="Soundcard.jpg" alt="Image of a sound card">
				<p>The sound card, also known as audio card, is an internal expansion card. The sound card provides
				input and output of audio signal to and from the computer. </p>
				
				<h2 id="video card">Video Card</h2>
				<img src="Videocard.jpg" alt="Image of a video card">
				<p>Video Card displays image(s) on the monitor. It gets its data from the CPU and stores the information 
				to video RAM. It’s ported by the AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port). Inside the video card, there is a special 
				video card that scans the data and converts it to a digital image. </p>
				
				<h2 id="heat sink">Heat Sink and Fan</h2>
				<img src="Heatsink.jpg" alt="Image of a heat sink and fan">
				<p>The heat sink converts the generated heat from the device into a fluid medium, usually a liquid coolant 
				or air to regulate the temperature of the CPU. </p>
				<p>The fan is the black component beside the heat sink. The fan cools some of the components of the PC from 
				overheating and damaging the parts. There is a fan on the CPU and power supply. The CPU performs millions 
				of task per second so to prevent it from overheating while performing the millions of task the fan is 
				used. The power supply converts the electricity so to also prevent it from overheating the fan is used.</p>

				<h2 id="cd-rom drive">CD-ROM Drive</h2>
				<img src="CDROM.jpg" alt="Image of a CD-ROM drive">
				<p>CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is a small electronic component that is occasionally 
				called the brain of the PC. The CPU is responsible for two things. One of them is to carry out commands 
				to make the other hardware parts perform the action. The other responsibility is to process data. Although 
				the instructions the CPU performs are simple, they can execute millions and millions of instructions every 
				second.  The fact that the CPU can perform many tasks is what makes a PC powerful.</p>
				
				<h2 id="bios">BIOS</h2>
				<img src="Motherboard.
				<p>(Basic Input/Output System)
				BIOS is a common use of a flash memory. BIOS is a chip found in the motherboard that instructs the computer how to do basic functions such as booting and keyboard control. It identifies and configures data from the hardware in a computer
